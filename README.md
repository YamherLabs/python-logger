# python app

# run

```
python3 src/index.py
```

# debug

This operation redirects the output of your script to output.txt, rather than to the standard system output (stdout). The process is commonly known as stream redirection

```
python3 src/index.py > output.txt
```

Finally, if you want to add the output of consecutive executions to the end of output.txt, then you must use two angle brackets (>>) instead of one, just like this

python3 src/index.py >> output.txt
